          Thank you for your interest in getting in contact with me! My contact info is to the right below, but note that I get a lot of email, and recently have not been able to reply to all of it. In order to ensure that you get a proper response please read the prospective student section. </p>

          <p>I’m always happy to hear from motivated and enthusiastic students interested in my research areas. However, like most professors, I receive a high volume of emails and cannot respond to every inquiry. To increase the chances of your message receiving a response, please carefully read the following:</p>

            <p><strong>Email subject:</strong> Start your subject line with <code>[prospective-student]</code> so I know you've read these instructions.</p>
            <p><strong>Be specific:</strong> Generic emails are likely to be ignored (and may land in spam). Instead, mention which of my recent research topics or publications caught your interest and why.</p>
            <p> <strong>Show relevance:</strong> Highlight how your previous research or skills align with mine. Include links to papers, code, or other concrete contributions if possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Have a proposal?</strong> If you already have an idea or direction in mind, share a brief proposal. That’s always a bonus.</p>

 
  <p>If you haven’t worked in my research areas before, that’s okay—but make sure your message shows genuine interest and effort to understand what I do. Due to time constraints, I may not be able to reply to every email. Please don’t take it personally. Wishing you the best in your research journey!</p>
